NAME
    perl6-puppet-parser

SYNOPSIS
      use v6;
      use Puppet::Parser;

      # Just a stupid example
      my $module = 'class { foo }';

      my $parsed = Puppet::Parser::Grammar.parse($module);
      say $parsed.perl;

DESCRIPTION
    (Aims to be a) module to:

    parse Puppet modules
    automatically build documentation for them

    We're far away from that.

    This is mostly my initial attempts at learning Perl 6 grammars.
